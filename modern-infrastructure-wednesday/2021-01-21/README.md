# Modern Infrastructure Wednesday 2021-01-21

This week's episode was a guest appearance on the Docker Build show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_mLNzug2ho

In this episode, Lee Zen livecodes a modern web application. He starts off with building out a simple API.
As part of that, he shows how to refactor a program so that you can use the same code to both test locally
via a container and deploy to a Lambda function. He also covers how to do the same for the frontend.
